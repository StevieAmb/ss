            <h2>About The Founder</h2>
            <p>After 10 years of working in the non-profit space, Stevie (she/they) realized that she wants to utilize all her skills to help community organizers, 
              activists, joy bringers, and care providers be able to take a breath and rest. From running an after school program that gave four young people their 
              first jobs, which was a huge help to their family members, to fundraising for a friend who needed help while dealing with parental illnesses, Stevie’s
               mission has always been supporting the community, in whatever way possible.</p>
        
            <p>One of the things she has seen as missing as a breath-giving/rest-giving resource from care providers, activists, community organizers, and 
              joy bringers, though, is time. She wanted to give you that time back, and so SoftSolves was born.</p>

            <p>After about a year and a half of professional software engineering experience, first, at a start-up and then with Bitly, Stevie gained another tool in 
              her arsenal that she wants to use to support the community: web development and software engineering. As the internet becomes the new way that we find 
              and retain our community and create digital homes, Stevie wants to help you create a welcoming space for the people that matter to you.</p>

            <p>To Stevie, every line of code matters, because you, and the people you support matter. She promises to give your website the utmost attention, because 
              you deserve nothing less. From designing, to building, to deployment, to editing and re-designing, every part of the process gets her full attention. And
               you will be there every step of the way, because to Stevie, it’s a partnership, where we walk together to build an online space that reflects you, your 
               values, and the values of the people you want to reach.</p>

            <p>She is dedicated to being in service to you, because you are dedicated to being in service.</p>
